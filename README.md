# 🌾 AI AgriYield Predictor

**An AI-powered system that predicts crop yield based on soil health, weather, and environmental factors.**  
This project leverages machine learning and data analysis to assist farmers, agronomists, and policymakers in improving agricultural productivity through data-driven insights.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **AI AgriYield Predictor** analyzes soil, crop, and weather parameters to forecast expected yield.  
It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning to build an accurate prediction model.  
A Flask-based web interface enables users to upload input data and get instant predictions.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Processing & Cleaning:** Handles missing values, outliers, and normalization of agricultural data.  
- 🌾 **Model Training:** Uses regression and ensemble learning algorithms to predict yield accurately.  
- 🔍 **Feature Importance:** Highlights key soil and climate parameters influencing yield.  
- 🧩 **Visualization Dashboards:** Displays EDA and prediction comparisons (actual vs. predicted).  
- 🌐 **Web App Interface:** Built using Flask for easy interaction and deployment.  
- ☁️ **Deployment Ready:** Includes Procfile and Requirements.txt for seamless cloud deployment (e.g., Render, Heroku).

🔬 Model Workflow:

1.Data Collection: Soil, weather, and crop datasets are merged and cleaned.

2.Feature Engineering: Feature scaling and selection using correlation analysis.

3.Model Training: Algorithms like Linear Regression, RandomForest, and XGBoost are trained.

4.Evaluation: Metrics include RMSE, MAE, and R².

5.Prediction: Final model predicts yield for new unseen data.

6.Deployment: Integrated with Flask for real-time prediction via web interface.
